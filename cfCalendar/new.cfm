<cfset currentDate = now()>
<cfset selectedMonth = form.month ?: month(currentDate)>
<cfset variables.selectedYear = form.year ?: year(currentDate)>



<cfset firstDayOfMonth = createDate(variables.selectedYear, selectedMonth, 1)>


createDate(variables.selectedYear, selectedMonth, 1)
 generates a date representing the first day of the selected month and year. Example:
  - If `variables.selectedYear = 2023` and `selectedMonth = 12`, `firstDayOfMonth` will be `2023-12-01`.

---

### 3. **Find the Day of the Week for the First of the Selected Month**

```cfm
<cfset dayOfWeek = dayOfWeek(firstDayOfMonth)>
```

- `dayOfWeek(firstDayOfMonth)` returns the numeric day of the week for the first day of the selected month.
  - Sunday = 1
  - Monday = 2
  - Tuesday = 3
  - Wednesday = 4
  - Thursday = 5
  - Friday = 6
  - Saturday = 7

---

### 4. **Add Empty Divs for the Days Before the First Date**

```cfm
<cfloop index="i" from="1" to="#dayOfWeek - 1#">
   <div></div>
</cfloop>
```

**Explanation:**
- The idea is to create "empty" cells at the start of a calendar month to align the dates properly under their respective days of the week.
- The loop runs from `1` to `dayOfWeek - 1`.
  - For example:
    - If `dayOfWeek = 4` (e.g., Thursday), then the first three cells (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday) will be empty.
- Each loop iteration creates an empty `<div>`.

---

### 5. **Calculate the Number of Days in the Selected Month**

```cfm
<cfset daysInMonth = daysInMonth(firstDayOfMonth)>
```

- `daysInMonth(firstDayOfMonth)` returns the number of days in the month of the provided date. Example:
  - If `firstDayOfMonth = 2023-12-01`, then `daysInMonth = 31`.

---

### 6. **Define Total Number of Displayable Cells in the Calendar**

```cfm
<cfset totalCells = 42>
```

- In a calendar view with a grid format, most calendar grids have **6 rows x 7 columns = 42 cells** (to accommodate months that span up to 6 weeks).
- This sets the total number of calendar cells to 42.

---

### 7. **Determine the Number of Filled Calendar Cells**

```cfm
<cfset filledCells = dayOfWeek + daysInMonth - 1>
```

- This calculates how many cells will have actual content (dates) in the calendar:
  - `dayOfWeek`: Number of leading empty cells (before the first day of the month).
  - `daysInMonth`: The total number of actual days in the month.
  - `dayOfWeek + daysInMonth - 1`: Sum of days that will occupy the calendar.

---

### 8. **Calculate Empty Cells Remaining**

```cfm
<cfset emptyCells = totalCells - filledCells>
```

- Here:
  - `totalCells = 42`: Represents the fixed total number of slots in a 6 x 7 calendar grid.
  - `filledCells`: The actual days filled by valid dates and leading spaces.
  - `emptyCells = totalCells - filledCells`: Calculates how many trailing empty cells are needed to fill the entire calendar grid to 42 cells.

---

### **Summary of Logic**

1. The logic first checks if a month and year are provided; if not, it uses the current month and year.
2. Determine the first day of the selected month (`firstDayOfMonth`) and the day of the week that the first of the month lands on (`dayOfWeek`).
3. Insert empty cells (`<div></div>`) at the start of the calendar to account for days of the week that precede the first date of the month.
4. Calculate how many valid calendar cells are occupied by days of the month (`daysInMonth + dayOfWeek - 1`) and how many additional trailing empty cells are needed to ensure the entire 42 cells in the 6x7 calendar grid are filled.
